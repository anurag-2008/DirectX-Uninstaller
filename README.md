With DirectX Uninstaller, you can easily uninstall DirectX without the need to manually delete any .dll files, allowing for a clean reinstallation of DirectX afterwards.

## How to Use?
It's simple, Just check or uncheck the 'Keep Backup' option as you prefer. If checked, the files will be backed up in your Desktop folder; if unchecked, they will go to the Recycle Bin.
